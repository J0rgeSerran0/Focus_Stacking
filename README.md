# Focus Stacking
Macro or micro photography using focus stacking technique

## Description
Focus stacking is one of the best technics used when you can not handle the scene and the current depth of field capabilities

The idea behind focus stacking is take multiple photos of the same scene varying the depth of field, focusing manually and sh. The number of photos taken depends of the object, scene, etc

The depth of field is affected by three key factors (lens focal length, distance to the subject, lens aperture). We will have to mix these factors or take into account which of all them is the most important for us

After take the photos of a scene (imagine 50 photos with different depth of fields), we will need to stack all the photos

To do this, we will need to use a special Software that will help us to get our goal

Note: when we want to take photos, we will need additional accessories like a tripod, special light, extensor rings, remote shutter,...

## Steps to take photos
- Mount your camera on a tripod
- Set your camera to manual mode
- Set your lens to manual focus (AF/**MF**)
- Set the ISO to 100 or a low value
- Set the light of the scene properly
- Set the exposure
- Compose your photo
- Take a sample picture, review the histogram and change if is neccesary (repeat this until be confortable)
- Move the focus to background to be ready

After this, we will be ready to take our photos. Is important to use a remote shutter to avoid movements

We will take a photo with the focus selected, and we will move the focus very few, and we will take another photo

Repeat this action until be confortable with the photos taken

## Stack the photos
Stack the photos will create a single image of all images we took

Here, we can use a Software to help us with this task (I will talk about this in other section)

And finally, we will use a Software to retouch some values of the image to finish it
